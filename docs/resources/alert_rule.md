# phare_alert_rule (Resource)

Manages a Phare alert rule that triggers notifications based on platform events.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Alert rule for incident notifications
resource "phare_alert_rule" "incident_alerts" {
  event          = "uptime.incident.created"
  integration_id = 1 # ID of your notification integration (Slack, email, etc.)
  rate_limit     = 0 # No rate limiting (send alert for every incident)
}

# Alert rule with rate limiting
resource "phare_alert_rule" "monitor_changes" {
  event          = "uptime.monitor.updated"
  integration_id = 1
  rate_limit     = 60 # Send at most once per hour
}

# Alert rule scoped to specific project
resource "phare_alert_rule" "project_incidents" {
  event          = "uptime.incident.created"
  integration_id = 2
  rate_limit     = 15  # Send at most once every 15 minutes
  project_id     = 123 # Optional: scope to specific project
}

# Alert rule for resolved incidents
resource "phare_alert_rule" "resolved_alerts" {
  event          = "uptime.incident.resolved"
  integration_id = 1
  rate_limit     = 0
}

# Alert rule for unhealthy integrations
resource "phare_alert_rule" "integration_health" {
  event          = "platform.integration.health.unhealthy"
  integration_id = 1
  rate_limit     = 360 # Once every 6 hours
}
```
